### Branching Strategy

- `master` branch is for production. A push to master automatically deploys to production.
- Use feature branches for individual features and fixes.
- GitHub Actions will run checks on pull requests and handle deployment.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The application uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

1. On pull requests:
    - `pr-check.yaml` runs tests and code quality checks

2. On push to `master`:
    - `build-deploy.yaml` builds and deploys the application
    - You can track deployment progress in the Actions tab
